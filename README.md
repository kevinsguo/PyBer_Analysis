# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This challenge analyzes the rideshare data and compare the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the average fares for each of the city types. As a result, a generalzation plot of the total fare per each city type was calculated based on the analysis.

## Results

From the summary shown in the following figurem it is clear that most rides do occur in urban cities. However, the average fare per ride and per driver are less in relative to Rural or Suburban areas. The data does reflect a correct scenario, where population density has a significant impact on the number of rides, while the traveling distance on average will have an affect on the average fare per driver and per ride.
